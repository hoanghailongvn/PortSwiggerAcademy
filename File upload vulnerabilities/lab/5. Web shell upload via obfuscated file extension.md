# [Lab: Web shell upload via obfuscated file extension](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-obfuscated-file-extension)

## Lab

This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed using a classic obfuscation technique.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file  `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials:  `wiener:peter`
