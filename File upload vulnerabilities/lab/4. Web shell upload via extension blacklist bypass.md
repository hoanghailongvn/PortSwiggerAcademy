# [Lab: Web shell upload via extension blacklist bypass](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-extension-blacklist-bypass)

## Lab

This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed due to a fundamental flaw in the configuration of this blacklist.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file  `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials:  `wiener:peter`

## Solution

- try directly upload php shellcode: blocked by blacklist
- upload file .htaccess:

    ```htaccess
    AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .html
    ```

- this makes the server execute php code inside html file
- upload html file but the content is php shellcode:
- access the the uploaded html file, boom

Lab Solved
