The Web Security Academy is a online training center for web application security.

Every article by portswigger academy is awesome. I will not write down each item of the article as I did at first. I just document the steps from discovery to exploitation of each type of vulnerability.

## Tips

temporarily proxy your whole terminal tools to Burpsuite:

```bash
export http_proxy=127.0.0.1:8080
export https_proxy=127.0.0.1:8080
```
