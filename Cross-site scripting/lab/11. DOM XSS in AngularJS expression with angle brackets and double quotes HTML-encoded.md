# [Lab: DOM XSS in AngularJS expression with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-angularjs-expression)

## Lab

This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in a AngularJS expression within the search functionality.

AngularJS is a popular JavaScript library, which scans the contents of HTML nodes containing the `ng-app` attribute (also known as an AngularJS directive). When a directive is added to the HTML code, you can execute JavaScript expressions within double curly braces. This technique is useful when angle brackets are being encoded.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that executes an AngularJS expression and calls the `alert` function.

## AngularJS

AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It can be added to an HTML page with a `<script>` tag.

AngularJS extends HTML attributes with Directives, and binds data to HTML with Expressions.

## ng-app

The `ng-app` directive tells AngularJS that this is the root element of the AngularJS application.

From [comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RVgvuGsEo8&t=122s&ab_channel=MichaelSommer):
We know we cant simply insert an “alert(1)” function because that function isnt defined in the scope object. Behind the scenes “alert(1)” turns into “$scope.alert(1)”

By default the scope object contains another object called “constructor” which contains a function also called “constructor“. This function can be used to dynamically generate and execute code. This is exactly what we need to execute our XSS payload as shown below

## Analysis

detected angular js using wappalyzer.

the body element has `ng-app` attribute:

```html
<body ng-app>
...
```

## Solutions

```js
{{$on.constructor('alert(1)')()}}
```

or

```js
{{construct.constructor('alert(1)')}}
```
