# [Lab: Reflected XSS with event handlers and href attributes blocked](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-event-handlers-and-href-attributes-blocked)

## Lab

This lab contains a reflected XSS vulnerability with some whitelisted tags, but all events and anchor `href` attributes are blocked..

To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that injects a vector that, when clicked, calls the `alert` function.

Note that you need to label your vector with the word "Click" in order to induce the simulated lab user to click your vector. For example:

```html
<a href="">Click me</a>
```

## Analysis

This lab block some tags and events, use intruder to determine:

- allowed tags:
  - svg
  - a
  - animate
  - ...
- allowed events: none
