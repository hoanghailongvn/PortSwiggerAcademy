# [Lab: DOM XSS in jQuery anchor href attribute sink using location.search source](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-jquery-href-attribute-sink)

## Lab

This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the submit feedback page. It uses the jQuery library's `$` selector function to find an anchor element, and changes its `href` attribute using data from `location.search`.

To solve this lab, make the "back" link alert `document.cookie`.

## Analysis

I have no experience with jquery, but let's break.

in the url, there is a parameter `returnPath=/`, this looks interesting.

review source code:

```js
<script>
    $(function() {
        $('#backLink').attr("href", (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('returnPath'));
    });
</script>
```

## Solutions

I tried to break the brackets but it didn't work, maybe this is how the JQuery work.

solution is:

```url
https://id.web-security-academy.net/feedback?returnPath=javascript:alert(1)
```

When user click to `back` button, xss is triggered.
