# [Lab: Blind OS command injection with out-of-band data exfiltration](https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-blind-out-of-band-data-exfiltration)

## Lab

This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.

The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The command is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response. It is not possible to redirect output into a location that you can access. However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain.

To solve the lab, execute the `whoami` command and exfiltrate the output via a DNS query to Burp Collaborator. You will need to enter the name of the current user to complete the lab.
