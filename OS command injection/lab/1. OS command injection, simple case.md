# [Lab: OS command injection, simple case](https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-simple)

## Lab

This lab contains an OS command injection vulnerability in the product stock checker.

The application executes a shell command containing user-supplied product and store IDs, and returns the raw output from the command in its response.

To solve the lab, execute the `whoami` command to determine the name of the current user.
