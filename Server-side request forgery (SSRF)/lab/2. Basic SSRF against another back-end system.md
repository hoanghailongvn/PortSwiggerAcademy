# [Lab: Basic SSRF against another back-end system](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-backend-system)

## Lab

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, use the stock check functionality to scan the internal `192.168.0.X` range for an admin interface on port 8080, then use it to delete the user `carlos`.

## Scan

- Burpsuite scanner: detected `Out-of-band resource load (HTTP)`
  - body: `stockApi=http://knbwyjlwtx7jmf2crvupaw6roiuci26vunhd52.oastify.com/product/stock/check?productId=2&storeId=1`
