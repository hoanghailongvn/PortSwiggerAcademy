## Lab

This site uses analytics software which fetches the URL specified in the Referer header when a product page is loaded.

To solve the lab, use this functionality to cause an HTTP request to the public Burp Collaborator server.

## Scan

Burpsuite `collaborator everywhere` extension: detected `Collaborator Pingback (HTTP): Referer` at `/product`.

## Solutions

```http
GET /product?productId=5 HTTP/1.1
...
Referer: https://collaborator
```
