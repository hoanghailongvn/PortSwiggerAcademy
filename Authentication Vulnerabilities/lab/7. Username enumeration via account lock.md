# [Lab: Username enumeration via account lock](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based/lab-username-enumeration-via-account-lock)

## Lab

This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration. It uses account locking, but this contains a logic flaw. To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

- [Candidate usernames](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-usernames)
- [Candidate passwords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords)

## Error

Apply bruteforce prevention only to already existing usernames, and it actually doesn't help against bruteforce attacks.

## Solutions

1. use intruder to enumerate username

    - mode: cluster bomb
    - positions:
      - `username=§wiener§&password=a§peter§`
    - payloads:
      - set 1: [Candidate usernames](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-usernames)
      - set 2: null payload, generate 5
    - grep - extract: string `Invalid username or password`

    - result: only responses for one user is longer with message `You have made too many incorrect login attempts`

2. find password:

- mode: sniper
- positions:
  - `username=alerts&password=§peter§`
- payloads: [Candidate passwords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords)
- grep - extract: string `Invalid username or password`
- result: can still log in with one of the passwords
