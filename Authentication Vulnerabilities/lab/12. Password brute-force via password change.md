# [Lab: Password brute-force via password change](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/other-mechanisms/lab-password-brute-force-via-password-change)

## Lab

This lab's password change functionality makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. To solve the lab, use the list of candidate passwords to brute-force Carlos's account and access his "My account" page.

- Your credentials: `wiener`:`peter`
- Victim's username: `carlos`
- [Candidate passwords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords)

## Analysis

bruteforce prevention at login page

## Solutions

If the two entries for the new password match, the account is locked. However, if you enter two different new passwords, an error message simply states Current password is incorrect. If you enter a valid current password, but two different new passwords, the message says New passwords do not match. We can use this message to enumerate correct passwords.
