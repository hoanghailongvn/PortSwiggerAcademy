# [Lab: Brute-forcing a stay-logged-in cookie](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/other-mechanisms/lab-brute-forcing-a-stay-logged-in-cookie)

## Lab

This lab allows users to stay logged in even after they close their browser session. The cookie used to provide this functionality is vulnerable to brute-forcing.

To solve the lab, brute-force Carlos's cookie to gain access to his "My account" page.

- Your credentials: `wiener`:`peter`
- Victim's username: `carlos`
- [Candidate passwords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords)

## Analysis

cookies:

- session: get after login
- stay-logged-in: get if logged in with stay-loggen-in is ticked

user authentication: just need a cookie, `session` or `stay-log-in`

## stay-logged-in cookie

`stay-logged-in` of `wiener` account:

- `d2llbmVyOjUxZGMzMGRkYzQ3M2Q0M2E2MDExZTllYmJhNmNhNzcw`
- b64-decoded: `wiener:51dc30ddc473d43a6011e9ebba6ca770`
- `51dc30ddc473d43a6011e9ebba6ca770` is mde('peter')

=> stay-logged-in = base64(username:md5(password))

## Solutions

bruteforce using password wordlist => solved
