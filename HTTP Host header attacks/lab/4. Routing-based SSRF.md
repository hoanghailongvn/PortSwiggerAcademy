# [Lab: Routing-based SSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting/lab-host-header-routing-based-ssrf)

## Lab

This lab is vulnerable to routing-based SSRF via the Host header. You can exploit this to access an insecure intranet admin panel located on an internal IP address.

To solve the lab, access the internal admin panel located in the `192.168.0.0/24` range, then delete Carlos.
