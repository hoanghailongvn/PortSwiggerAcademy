# [Lab: Referer-based access control](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-referer-based-access-control)

This lab controls access to certain admin functionality based on the Referer header. You can familiarize yourself with the admin panel by logging in using the credentials  `administrator:admin`.

To solve the lab, log in using the credentials  `wiener:peter`  and exploit the flawed  [access controls](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control)  to promote yourself to become an administrator.
