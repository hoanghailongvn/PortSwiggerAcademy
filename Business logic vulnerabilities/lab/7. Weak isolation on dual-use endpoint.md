# [Lab: Weak isolation on dual-use endpoint](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-weak-isolation-on-dual-use-endpoint)

## Lab

This lab makes a flawed assumption about the user's privilege level based on their input. As a result, you can exploit the logic of its account management features to gain access to arbitrary users' accounts. To solve the lab, access the `administrator` account and delete Carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`
