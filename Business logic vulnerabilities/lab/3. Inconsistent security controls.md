# [Lab: Inconsistent security controls](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-inconsistent-security-controls)

## Lab

This lab's flawed logic allows arbitrary users to access administrative functionality that should only be available to company employees. To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete Carlos.

## Analysis

register page:

- announcement: `If you work for DontWannaCry, please use your @dontwannacry.com email address`
- To register an account, we need a confirmation url sent to email => can't fake an account with `@dontwannacry.com email` through register function

my-account page:

- update email function: no confirmation url needed

## Solutions

register an account with hacker email, then use the update email function to change the email to `abc@dontwannacry.com`. => admin panel appears.

solved
