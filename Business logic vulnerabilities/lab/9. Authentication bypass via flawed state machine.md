# [Lab: Authentication bypass via flawed state machine](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-authentication-bypass-via-flawed-state-machine)

## Lab

This lab makes flawed assumptions about the sequence of events in the login process. To solve the lab, exploit this flaw to bypass the lab's authentication, access the admin interface, and delete Carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

## Analysis

server logic:

1. login:

    ```http
    POST /login HTTP/1.1

    csrf=ajJK312301QKBTdbz3pU4vGbR6Q1Sq3K&username=wiener&password=peter
    ```

2. get role-selector page:

    ```http
    GET /role-selector HTTP/1.1
    ```

3. post role-selector

    ```http
    POST /role-selector HTTP/1.1
    Cookie: session=XZp3wqGgIr4gERJA3idzlhiT2CMnhqRG
    
    role=user&csrf=TTPUfFGlXCFfXGpBzYDsiylS0z1We7BU
    ```

## Solutions

use burpsuite to drop the `get role-selector page` request.

=> logged as `administrator` role

solved
