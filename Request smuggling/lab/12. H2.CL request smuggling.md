# [Lab: H2.CL request smuggling](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/advanced/lab-request-smuggling-h2-cl-request-smuggling)

## Lab

This lab is vulnerable to request smuggling because the front-end server downgrades HTTP/2 requests even if they have an ambiguous length.

To solve the lab, perform a request smuggling attack that causes the victim's browser to load and execute a malicious JavaScript file from the exploit server, calling `alert(document.cookie)`. The victim user accesses the home page every 10 seconds.

## Detected H2.CL

- burpsuite active scan: detected hidden http 2
- burpsuite `HTTP request smuggler` extension: detected `Issue:Â CL.0 desync: h2CL|GET /favicon.ico`

## Detected refected xss

`/post/comment/confirmation?postId="><img%20src=1%20onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`

## Solutions
