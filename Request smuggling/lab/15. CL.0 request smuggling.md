# [Lab: CL.0 request smuggling](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/browser/cl-0/lab-cl-0-request-smuggling)

## Lab

This lab is vulnerable to CL.0 request smuggling attacks. The back-end server ignores the `Content-Length` header on requests to some endpoints.

To solve the lab, identify a vulnerable endpoint, smuggle a request to the back-end to access to the admin panel at `/admin`, then delete the user `carlos`.

## Solutions
